# Welcome to The Disneyland Tracker App<img width="1267" alt="log in page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c7f4a9e-57b7-4c8e-8a74-5687a4228d4b" />

## Project Description
### The Disneyland Tracker app will help you visit the rides you plan for in the limited time you have.
This responsive app will let you create a personalised list of all the rides you want to visit while on your trip at Disneyland. You'll be able to add whatever ride is available at the resort, activley keep track of any rides you have already been on and see any of the remaining ones you have yet to visit, easily and responsively on your phone while you travel around the resort. You can easily pick from a list of pre-built ride names or add your own name for the ride. Once you have marked them as complete, their status is marked as such, making it easy to see any rides you have yet to visit. If you add an incorrect ride you can easily delete it or edit it. The Disneyland Tracker app will save you so much time and get you organised for maximum fun. If you only have a single day pass at the resort then this app is a must have.

## User Demographics
This app is designed for Disneyland visitors looking to make the most of their time—whether they’re first-time guests eager to see it all, seasoned park-goers optimizing their schedule, or families navigating a packed day with kids. It’s ideal for anyone who values efficiency, wants clear visibility into their ride checklist, and prefers a convenient mobile solution to plan their day on-the-go. Whether you have a single-day pass or a multi-day trip, if your priority is to stay organized, save time, and ensure you don’t miss the must-do attractions, this app was built for you.
# UX
## Database Planning
The chosen Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is deliberately kept simple to maintain a clear focus on delivering the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This straightforward approach sets a well-defined foundation while preserving the flexibility to develop a new ERD if substantial features or changes are introduced later on.
![Database Entity Relationship Diagram]<img width="633" alt="ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fd3d89f-51f8-4c97-8a73-c71acc622b78" />

Below is a basic user flow chart that focuses on the foundational interactions—registering, logging in, configuring a custom user model, and reaching the home page. Features like adding, deleting, or editing items aren’t included in this initial diagram, as it’s centered on the core functionality required to get users into the app and ready to engage. Future iterations of the flow chart will incorporate these additional steps as the project evolves beyond the Minimum Viable Product stage.<img width="517" alt="USER FLOW CHART" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/646baedb-cb49-48d2-94b1-bd33156810a6" />
